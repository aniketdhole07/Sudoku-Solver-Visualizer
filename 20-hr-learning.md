#### Learn Anything in 20Hours

Josh Kaufman explains how to practice intelligently and [how to learn any new skill in 20 hours.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY)

He gave us 4 tips:

**1) Deconstruct the Skill:**
Break the skill into simple subskills.The more you can break apart the skill, the more you’re able to prioritize the subskills.And if you practice the most important things first, you’ll be able to improve your performance in the least amount of time possible.      
For example, If you are learning programming you break skills into subskills like like Algorithms,Programming Language,Data Structures,Problem Solving,etc.

**2)Learn Enough to Self Correct:**
When you start practicing you want to learn so that you can generate feedback and correct yourself.So learn from good resources and identify and correct mistakes.   
For example, If you start learning code you might get some errors so you again check some coding videos and correct youeself,so when doing this check assured and valid resources.

**3)Remove Practice Barriers:**
Try to reduce distractions like social media,television,etc.This will slow  down your learning.

**4)Practice at least 20 hours:**
Keep making improvements over 20 hours,and don't quit before practicing.

> “The major barrier to learn something new is not intellectual, it’s not the process of learning a bunch of little tips or tricks or things.The major barrier is emotional."

**Keep Learning**
