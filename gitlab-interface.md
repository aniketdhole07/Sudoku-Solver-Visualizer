# Gitlab Interface

## Setting up Gitlab
This is the screen after you have singed up and logged in succesfully.

This dashboard is not similar to Github in UI, but the functionalities are pretty similar. Look at the top bar, you got *Groups*, *Activity*, *Milestones*.

Some differences that should be noticed are:  
- **Pull request** => **Merge request** and displayed with this ![](pr_icon.png) icon.
- **Organisations** => **Group** as shown in ![](group.png) 
- **Gist** => **Snippets** 

## Create your first new project  
While there are not many options for creating new projects (=repositories) on Github, Gitlab has a bunch of options to choose from, notably: 

#### Blank project 
You get three **levels of visibility**. Aside from the regularly seen **private** and **public**, they offer **internal**, of which openness is limited to logged in user only.
 
#### Import project from other services.
This is too easy an option. Gitlab already provided a [guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/import/github.html) for it.
#### CI/CD for external repo

Everything else is similar to what Github offers.
